# secret

personal project in AI whose object was to perform facial recognition of an image by uploading using the Python3 openCV2 library which calls a facebook graph API webservice: github link: https://github.com/raidentel /secret

this project was purely python3 on a Django web server with a colleague specializing in web design and computer graphics

  - unfortunately the project was not successful because we did not have a solid information base and Facebook API GRAPH was limited at the time.
Please consider our motivation.
